ðŸŒ± Hello! I'm a senior at Cornell University studying Computer Science with minors in Mathematics and AI. I enjoy reasoning about topics in algorithmic game theory and machine learning. A few of my favorite subtopics include Multi-Agent Reinforcement Learning (MARL), cognitive computing, and interpretability.

Feel free to reach out! pgr39 [at] cornell [dot] edu
